# ElevatorSaga

This algorithim starts out with 2 elevators waiting on the zero floor for people to come inside.
Once people enter the elevator, it takes them to their desired floor. If once they arrive more people
enter the elevator, it will take them to their desired place until the elevator is empty. 
Once the elevator is empty, it will go back to floor zero and start the process all over again.
